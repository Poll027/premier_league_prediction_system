A. League Info

league_id (required to fetch standings, fixtures, stats)

league_name

B. Team Info

team_id (link between API & Transfermarkt team)

stadium

founded

coach_name

C. Standings Data

rank (current position in league table)

points

matches_played

goals_for

goals_against

goal_difference

D. Fixtures & Results

fixture_id

date

home_team_id, away_team_id

3. How to Link Transfermarkt Data with API Data
Transfermarkt Column	API Column to MatchJoin On	Notes
team_name	team_name (API)	Might need cleaning to match exactly (remove FC, accents, etc.)
player_name	player_name (API)	Clean special characters, match case-insensitively
(none in TM dataset)	team_id (API)	Store this after first lookup so you don’t keep matching by name
(none in TM dataset)	player_id (API)	Store this for live player updates
market_value	(from TM only)	API usually doesn’t have this
(none in TM dataset)	standings data	Merge by team_id
(none in TM dataset)	player stats	Merge by player_id or cleaned player_name + team_id

✅ Next Step for You
Before you fetch stats from the API, you need a Team & Player ID mapping table.
That’s your “Rosetta Stone” — once you have it, every API request becomes straightforward.
